The brain is the interaction of voltages.

Binaural beats, theta, beta, etc waves.

When you're at a gig, peoples brains are literally harmonised.

I recently read a book, **This is Your Brain on Music** by Daniel Levitin, and I had some **big realisations**.

It all starts waaaay back, when I became a [Creative Technologist](/creative-technologist) and [Programmer](/programmer). Back then I was building [human interactive experiences](/projects) for companies like Google. A lot of the interactive experiences involved sensors, like IR sensors, presence sensors.
