## Ant Frisby the Creative Technologist

I started coding properly when I was 23.

Although I'd had some spats with html & css previously, and had built some robots as a child, I didn't take the plunge and actually learn about real programming until I got fired from my job.

I did a music degree, but realised I really wanted to know how to write software, program things, understand what c++ was and generally perform magic.

Once I was free, I locked myself in my basement with the internet and proceeded to teach myself to code, consuming courses from MIT, youtube videos, blog posts, tutorials, downloading open source software platforms and studying them in meticulous detail.

I'd find myself getting so carried away I sometimes would disappear down there and wouldn't return till 8 o'clock in the morning when all my housemates were having breakfast and getting ready to go to their real jobs. They all thought i'd gone completely insane, which arguably i had. I just knew I was doing what I wanted to do and I loved it.

I launched a number of software platforms including a Spanish ham import/export company.
